Currently, I am studying as a **control and automation engineering** at [Unifei](https://unifei.edu.br) where I study python, C, C++, project management and Ai.

I did my high school education at ETEC Pedro Ferreira alves as a Mechatronic technician in Mogi Mirim.

Here is a random fact about me - I have been on this planet for **7944 days**.

And here is a just a random fact -  **More than 100 professional cyclists participate in the Tour de France every year and the race is over 3,200 kilometers**.
