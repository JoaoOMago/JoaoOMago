# Welcome <img src="happy.gif" height="64px" /> <img src="wave.gif" height="32px" />

I am João, a  **control and automation engineering student** and **mechatronic technician** based in Brazil Br.

Currently, I am studying as a **control and automation engineering** at [Unifei](https://unifei.edu.br) where I study python, C, C++, project management and Ai.

I did my high school education at ETEC Pedro Ferreira alves as a Mechatronic technician in Mogi Mirim.

Here is a random fact about me - I have been on this planet for **7754 days**.

And here is a just a random fact -  **A Connecticut Toy maker, Herobuilders, sells action figures of President George W. Bush, Islamic militant Osama bin Laden, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, which are all major figures tied to the September 11, 2001 WTC attacks**.
