# Welcome <img src="happy.gif" height="64px" /> <img src="wave.gif" height="32px" />

I am João, a  **control and automation engineering student** and **mechatronic technician** based in Brazil Br.

Currently, I am studying as a **control and automation engineering** at [Unifei](https://unifei.edu.br) where I study python, C, C++, project management and Ai.

I did my high school education at ETEC Pedro Ferreira alves as a Mechatronic technician in Mogi Mirim.

Here is a random fact about me - I have been on this planet for **7427 days**.

And here is a just a random fact -  **During the making of the the movie "Fight Club," actor Brad Pitt chipped his tooth. However, he did not get his tooth capped until after the movie was done filming as he thought it would look better chipped for his character**.
