I am João, a  **control and automation engineering student** and **mechatronic technician** based in Brazil Br.

Currently, I am studying as a **control and automation engineering** at [Unifei](https://unifei.edu.br) where I study python, C, C++, project management and Ai.

And here is a just a random fact -  **Scientists have discovered a way to make biodegradable plastic from plants by using genetic engineering.**.
