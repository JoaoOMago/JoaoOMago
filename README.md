# Welcome <img src="happy.gif" height="64px" /> <img src="wave.gif" height="32px" />

I am João, a  **control and automation engineering student** and **mechatronic technician** based in Brazil Br.

Currently, I am studying as a **control and automation engineering** at [Unifei](https://unifei.edu.br) where I study python, C, C++, project management and Ai.

I did my high school education at ETEC Pedro Ferreira alves as a Mechatronic technician in Mogi Mirim.

Here is a random fact about me - I have been on this planet for **7822 days**.

And here is a just a random fact -  **Leather skin does not have any smell. The leather smell that you sense is actually derived from the materials used in the tanning process**.
